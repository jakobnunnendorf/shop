# [Title Comment - CSV UUID Replacement]

# [Overview - This script manipulates product data by assigning a unique identifier (UUID) to each product read from the 'products_rows.csv' file and writes the result into an 'output.csv' file.]

# [Type environment]
# Input: CSV file ('products_rows.csv')
# Output: CSV file ('output.csv')
# The script operates on CSV files. The csv.reader object reads rows from the input file and the csv.writer object writes rows into the output file.

import csv
import uuid

# [Functional section - Opening files and setting up CSV reader and writer]
# Opening the CSV files in read mode ('input_file') and write mode ('output_file')
with open('/Users/jakobnunnendorf/Github/shop/public/cases/products_rows.csv', 'r') as input_file, open('/Users/jakobnunnendorf/Github/shop/public/cases/output.csv', 'w', newline='') as output_file:
    
    # Setting up CSV reader and writer
    reader = csv.reader(input_file)
    writer = csv.writer(output_file)

    # [Functional section - Processing header row]
    # Reading the header row and writing it to the output file
    headers = next(reader)
    writer.writerow(headers)

    # [Functional section - Processing data rows]
    # For each row, replacing the first column (product ID) with a new UUID
    for row in reader:
        # Generating a new UUID and replacing the first column
        row[0] = str(uuid.uuid4())
        # Writing the modified row to the output file
        writer.writerow(row)

# Suggestions for Improvement:
# 1. Consider using the csv DictReader and DictWriter classes for more readable and robust code.
# 2. Error handling could be improved, such as adding checks for file opening success and catching potential exceptions.
# 3. It might be more flexible to make the paths of the input and output files as command-line arguments or config parameters instead of hardcoding.
